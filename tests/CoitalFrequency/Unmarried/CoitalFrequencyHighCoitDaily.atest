title	Coital Frequency High Coital Thresholds: Check of Unmarried High CoitFreq Thresholds 
comments	This test assigns all unmarried agents to the high coitfreq category and then sets the Minimum and Maximum thresholds for that category equal to 1, which should result in agents having the same amount of sex (this test is probably redundant).
